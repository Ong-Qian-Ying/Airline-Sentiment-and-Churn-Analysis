## Executive Summary:
SkyWings Airlines faced a sharp revenue decline (Business −26%, Economy −18% YoY) alongside rising dissatisfaction posted online. Using KNIME text mining and Tableau KPI dashboards, my team and I linked customer reviews + transactions to pinpoint the biggest drivers: cancellations at 15% vs 2% industry benchmark, and complaints concentrated in poor customer service (35.08%) and low quality perception (34.6%). Hence, we recommended the company to:

1. Reduce cancellations with proactive disruption handling (“service netting”) and faster recovery options.
2. Win back returning Economy customers (core revenue segment) via loyalty perks + targeted recovery offers.
3. Redesign promotions (only 16.91% promo usage) to be more visible and targeted.
